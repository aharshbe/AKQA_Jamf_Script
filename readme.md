# OSX Automated Provisioning Script 
## Purpose
* General troubleshooting and Jamf/Jss script for OSX provisioning
* This script can:
	* Add a helpful HTML tips and tricks page to the Desktop
	* Test and fix internet connectivity
	* Connect to company guest Wi-Fi
	* Troubleshoot and update Jamf policies
	* Check for and install system level updates
	* Create a specified Admin user with separate credentials for IT troubleshooting
	* Enable and obtain the status of FileVault encryption
	* Clean and document bugs*

### Usage:
* Clone repo, e.g., `git clone Repo_URL`
* open terminal and `cd` into cloned repo
*  type `./tshooter` to run troubleshooter

**Sadly I did not sign the app so you'll have to open it from the terminal and can't double-click. This is due to Gatekeeper preferences.
